# NautoPromo
Instructions, script, and service files to have Prometheus server automatically reach out to Nautobot for targets

Created by me for a University project regarding opensource technologies such as prometheus and nautobot. The way I have the script look through the query for the targets is not universal or efficient, so if you want to have this for your targets: modify the section of the script to look through the json for one IP per device
